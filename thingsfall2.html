            <small></small>
        <p>Okonkwo had just blown out the palm-oil lamp and stretched 
            himself on his bamboo bed when he heard the ogene of the town 
            crier piercing the still night air. Gome, gome, gome, gome, boomed 
            the hollow metal. Then the crier gave his message, and at the end 
            of it beat his instrument again. And this was the message. Every 
            man of Umuofia was asked to gather at the market place tomorrow 
            morning. Okonkwo wondered what was amiss, for he knew 
            certainly that something was amiss. He had discerned a clear 
            overtone of tragedy in the crier's voice, and even now he could still 
            hear it as it grew dimmer and dimmer in the distance. </p>  
            <p>
                The night was very quiet. It was always quiet except on moonlight 
nights. Darkness held a vague terror for these people, even the 
bravest among them. Children were warned not to whistle at night 
for fear of evil spirits. Dangerous animals became even more 
sinister and uncanny in the dark. A snake was never called by its 
name at night, because it would hear. It was called a string. And so 
on this particular night as the crier's voice was gradually 
swallowed up in the distance, silence returned to the world, a 
vibrant silence made more intense by the universal trill of a million 
million forest insects.
            </p>
            <p>On a moonlight night it would be different. The happy voices of 
                children playing in open fields would then be heard. And perhaps 
                those not so young would be playing in pairs in less open places, 
                and old men and women would remember their youth. As the Ibo 
                say: "When the moon is shining the cripple becomes hungry for a 
                walk. But this particular night was dark and silent. And in all the nine 
                villages of Umuofia a town crier with his ogene asked every man 
                to be present tomorrow morning. Okonkwo on his bamboo bed 
                tried to figure out the nature of the emergency - war with a 
                neighboring clan? That seemed the most likely reason, and he was 
                not afraid of war. He was a man of action, a man of war. Unlike his 
                father he could stand the look of blood. In Umuofia's latest war he 
                was the first to bring home a human head. That was his fifth head 
                and he was not an old man yet. On great occasions such as the 
                funeral of a village celebrity he drank his palm-wine from his first 
                human head.</p>

                <p>In the morning the market place was full. There must have been 
                    about ten thousand men there, all talking in low voices. At last 
                    Ogbuefi Ezeugo stood up in the midst of them and bellowed four 
                    times, "Umuofia kwenu," and on each occasion he faced a different 
                    direction and seemed to push the air with a clenched fist. And ten 
                    thousand men answered "Yaa!" each time. Then there was perfect 
                    silence. Ogbuefi Ezeugo was a powerful orator and was always 
                    chosen to speak on such occasions. He moved his hand over his 
                    white head and stroked his white beard. He then adjusted his cloth, 
                    which was passed under his right arm-pit and tied above his left 
                    shoulder.</p>

                    <p>"Umuofia kwenu," he bellowed a fifth time, and the crowd yelled 
                        in answer. And then suddenly like one possessed he shot out his 
                        left hand and pointed in the direction of Mbaino, and said through 
                        gleaming white teeth firmly clenched: "Those sons of wild animals 
                        have dared to murder a daughter of Umuofia." He threw his head 
                        down and gnashed his teeth, and allowed a murmur of suppressed 
                        anger to sweep the crowd. When he began again, the anger on his 
                        face was gone, and in its place a sort of smile hovered, more 
                        terrible and more sinister than the anger. And in a clear 
                        unemotional voice he told Umuofia how their daughter had gone to 
                        market at Mbaino and had been killed. That woman, said Ezeugo, 
                        was the wife of Ogbuefi Udo, and he pointed to a man who sat 
near him with a bowed head. The crowd then shouted with ainger 
and thirst for blood.</p>

                        <p>Many others spoke, and at the end it was decided to follow the 
                            normal course of action. An ultimatum was immediately 
                            dispatched to Mbaino asking them to choose between war - on the 
                            one hand, and on the other the offer of a young man and a virgin as 
                            compensation.    Umuofia was feared by all its neighbors. It was powerful in war 
                            and in magic, and its priests and medicine men were feared in all 
                            the surrounding country. Its most potent war-medicine was as old 
                            as the clan itself. Nobody knew how old. But on one point there 
                            was general agreement—the active principle in that medicine had 
                            been an old woman with one leg. In fact, the medicine itself was 
                            called agadi-nwayi, or old woman. It had its shrine in the centre of 
                            Umuofia, in a cleared spot. And if anybody was so foolhardy as to 
                            pass by the shrine after dusk he was sure to see the old woman 
                            hopping about. </p>

                            <p>And so the neighboring clans who naturally knew of these things 
                                feared Umuofia, and would not go to war against it without first 
                                trying a peaceful settlement. And in fairness to Umuofia it should 
                                be recorded that it never went to war unless its case was clear and 
                                just and was accepted as such by its Oracle - the Oracle of the Hills 
                                and the Caves. And there were indeed occasions when the Oracle 
                                had forbidden Umuofia to wage a war. If the clan had disobeyed 
                                the Oracle they would surely have been beaten, because their 
                                dreaded agadi-nwayi would never fight what the Ibo call a fight of 
                                blame.</p>

                                <p>But the war that now threatened was a just war. Even the enemy 
                                    clan knew that. And so when Okonkwo of Umuofia arrived at 
                                    Mbaino as the proud and imperious emissary of war, he was 
                                    treated with great honor and respect, and two days later he returned 
home with a lad of fifteen and a young virgin. The lad's name was 
Ikemefuna, whose sad story is still told in Umuofia unto this day. </p>

<p>The elders, or ndichie, met to hear a report of Okonkwo's mission. 
    At the end they decided, as everybody knew they would, that the 
    girl should go to Ogbuefi Udo to replace his murdered wife. As for 
    the boy, he belonged to the clan as a whole, and there was no hurry 
    to decide his fate. Okonkwo was, therefore, asked on behalf of the 
    clan to look after him in the interim. And so for three years 
    Ikemefuna lived in Okonkwo's household.</p>

    <p>Qkonkwo ruled his household with a heavy hand. His wives, 
        especially the youngest, lived in perpetual fear of his fiery temper, 
        and so did his little children. Perhaps down in his heart Okonkwo 
        was not a cruel man. But his whole life was dominated by fear, the 
        fear of failure and of weakness. It was deeper and more intimate 
        than the fear of evil and capricious gods and of magic, the fear of 
        the forest, and of the forces of nature, malevolent, red in tooth and 
        claw. Okonkwo's fear was greater than these. It was not external 
        but lay deep within himself. It was the fear of himself, lest he 
        should be found to resemble his father. Even as a little boy he had 
        resented his father's failure and weakness, and even now he still 
        remembered how he had suffered when a playmate had told him 
        that his father was agbala. That was how Okonkwo first came to 
        know that agbala was not only another name for a woman, it could 
        also mean a man who had taken no title. And so Okonkwo was 
        ruled by one passion - to hate everything that his father Unoka had 
        loved. One of those things was gentleness and another was idleness. </p>

        <p>During the planting season Okonkwo worked daily on his farms 
            from cock-crow until the chickens went to roost. He was a very 
            strong man and rarely felt fatigue. But his wives and young 
            children were not as strong, and so they suffered. But they dared 
            not complain openly. Okonkwo's first son, Nwoye, was then 
            twelve years old but was already causing his father great anxiety 
for his incipient laziness. At any rate, that was how it looked to his 
father, and he sought to correct him by constant nagging and 
beating. And so Nwoye was developing into a sad-faced youth. </p>

<p>Okonkwo's prosperity was visible in his household. He had a large 
    compound enclosed by a thick wall of red earth. His own hut, or 
    obi, stood immediately behind the only gate in the red walls. Each 
    of his three wives had her own hut, which together formed a half 
    moon behind the obi. The barn was built against one end of the red 
    walls, and long stacks of yam stood out prosperously in it. At the 
    opposite end of the compound was a shed for the goats, and each 
    wife built a small attachment to her hut for the hens. Near the barn 
    was a small house, the "medicine house" or shrine where Okonkwo 
    kept the wooden symbols of his personal god and of his ancestral 
    spirits. He worshipped them with sacrifices of kola nut, food and 
    palm-wine, and offered prayers to them on behalf of himself, his 
    three wives and eight children.</p>
        

    <p>So when the daughter of Umuofia was killed in Mbaino, 
        Ikemefuna came into Okonkwo's household. When Okonkwo 
        brought him home that day he called his most senior wife and 
        handed him over to her.   "He belongs to the clan," he told her. "So look after him." 
        "Is he staying long with us?" she asked. 
        "Do what you are told, woman," Okonkwo thundered, and 
        stammered. "When did you become one of the ndichie of 
        Umuofia?" 
        And so Nwoye's mother took Ikemefuna to her hut and asked no 
        more questions.</p>


        <p>As for the boy himself, he was terribly afraid. He could not 
            understand what was happening to him or what he had done. How 
            could he know that his father had taken a hand in killing a daughter 
            of Umuofia? All he knew was that a few men had arrived at their 
            house, conversing with his father in low tones, and at the end he 
            had been taken out and handed over to a stranger. His mother had 
            wept bitterly, but he had been too surprised to weep. And so the 
            stranger had brought him, and a girl, a long, long way from home, 
            through lonely forest paths. He did not know who the girl was, and 
            he never saw her again.</p>
