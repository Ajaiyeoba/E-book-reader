            <p>   Okonkwo did not have the start in life which many young men 
                usually had. He did not inherit a barn from his father. There was no 
                barn to inherit. The story was told in Umuofia, of how his father, 
                Unoka, had gone to consult the Oracle of the Hills and the Caves to 
                find out why he always had a miserable harvest.</p>

                <p>The Oracle was called Agbala, and people came from far and near 
                    to consult it. They came when misfortune dogged their steps or 
                    when they had a dispute with their neighbors. They came to 
                    discover what the future held for them or to consult the spirits of 
                    their departed fathers.</p>

                    <p>The way into the shrine was a round hole at the side of a hill, just a 
                        little bigger than the round opening into a henhouse. Worshippers 
                        and those who came to seek knowledge from the god crawled on 
                        their belly through the hole and found themselves in a dark, 
                        endless space in the presence of Agbala. No one had ever beheld 
                        Agbala, except his priestess. But no one who had ever crawled into 
                        his awful shrine had come out without the fear of his power. His  priestess stood by the sacred fire which she built in the heart of the 
                        cave and proclaimed the will of the god. The fire did not burn with 
                        a flame. The glowing logs only served to light up vaguely the dark 
                        figure of the priestess.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes a man came to consult the spirit of his dead father or 
                            relative. It was said that when such a spirit appeared, the man saw 
                            it vaguely in the darkness, but never heard its voice. Some people 
                            even said that they had heard the spirits flying and flapping their 
                            wings against the roof of the cave.</p>

                      <p>Many years ago when Okonkwo was still a boy his father, Unoka, 
                        had gone to consult Agbala. The priestess in those days was a 
                        woman called Chika. She was full of the power of her god, and she 
                        was greatly feared. Unoka stood before her and began his story.</p>
                      <p>"Every year," he said sadly, "before 1 put any crop in the earth, I 
                        sacrifice a cock to Ani, the owner of all land. It is the law of our 
                        fathers. I also kill a cock at the shrine of Ifejioku, the god of yams. 
                        I clear the bush and set fire to it when it is dry. I sow the yams 
                        when the first rain has fallen, and stake them when the young 
                        tendrils appear. I weed – I”; “Hold your peace!" screamed the 
                        priestess, her voice terrible as it echoed through the dark void. 
                        "You have offended neither the gods nor your fathers. And when a 
                        man is at peace with his gods and his ancestors, his harvest will be 
                        good or bad according to the strength of his arm. You, Unoka, are 
                        known in all the clan for the weakness of your machete and your 
                        hoe. When your neighbors go out with their ax to cut down virgin 
                        forests, you sow your yams on exhausted farms that take no labor 
                        to clear. They cross seven rivers to make their farms,- you stay at 
                        home and offer sacrifices to a reluctant soil. Go home and work 
                        like a man."</p>
                        
                        <p>Unoka was an ill-fated man. He had a bad chi or personal god, and 
                            evil fortune followed him to the grave, or rather to his death, for he 
                            had no grave. He died of the swelling which was an abomination to 
the earth goddess. When a man was afflicted with swelling in the 
stomach and the limbs he was not allowed to die in the house. He 
was carried to the Evil Forest and left there to die. There was the 
story of a very stubborn man who staggered back to his house and 
had to be carried again to the forest and tied to a tree. The sickness 
was an abomination to the earth, and so the victim could not be 
buried in her bowels. He died and rotted away above the earth, and 
was not given the first or the second burial. Such was Unoka's fate. 
When they carried him away, he took with him his flute.</p>

            <p>With a father like Unoka, Okonkwo did not have the start in life 
                which many young men had. He neither inherited a barn nor a title, 
                nor even a young wife. But in spite of these disadvantages, he had 
                begun even in his father's lifetime to lay the foundations of a 
                prosperous future. It was slow and painful. But he threw himself 
                into it like one possessed. And indeed he was possessed by the fear 
                of his father's contemptible life and shameful death.  </p>

                <p>There was a wealthy man in Okonkwo's village who had three 
                    huge barns, nine wives and thirty children. His name was 
                    Nwakibie and he had taken the highest but one title which a man 
                    could take in the clan. It was for this man that Okonkwo worked to 
                    earn his first seed yams. </p>

                    <p>He took a pot of palm-wine and a cock to Nwakibie. Two elderly 
                        neighbors were sent for, and Nwakibie's two grown-up sons were 
                        also present in his obi. He presented a kola nut and an alligator 
                        pepper, which were passed round for all to see and then returned to 
                        him. He broke the nut saying: We shall all live. We pray for life, 
                        children, a good harvest and happiness. You will have what is 
                        good for you and I will have what is good for me. Let the kite 
                        perch and let the eagle perch too. If one says no to the other, let his 
                        wing break." 
                        </p>

                        <p>After the kola nut had been eaten Okonkwo brought his palmwine from the corner of the hut where it had been placed and stood 
                            it in the center of the group. He addressed Nwakibie, calling him 
                            "Our father." 
                            "Nna ayi," he said. "1 have brought you this little kola. As our 
                            people say, a man who pays respect to the great paves the way for 
                            his own greatness. I have come to pay you my respects and also to 
                            ask a favor. But let us drink the wine first." </p>

                            <p>Everybody thanked Okonkwo and the neighbors brought out their 
                                drinking horns from the goatskin bags they carried. Nwakibie 
                                brought down his own horn, which was fastened to the rafters. The 
                                younger of his sons, who was also the youngest man in the group, 
                                moved to the center, raised the pot on his left knee and began to 
                                pour out the wine. The first cup went to Okonkwo, who must taste 
                                his wine before anyone else. Then the group drank, beginning with 
                                the eldest man. When everyone had drunk two or three horns, 
                                Nwakibie sent for his wives. Some of them were not at home and 
                                only four came in.</p>
