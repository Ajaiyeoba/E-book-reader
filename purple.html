    <p>Things started to fall apart at home when my brother, Jaja, did not
      go to communion and Papa flung his heavy missal across the room and broke
      the figurines on the étagère. We had just returned from church. Mama placed
      the fresh palm fronds, which were wet with holy water, on the dining table
      and then went upstairs to change. Later, she would knot the palm fronds into
      sagging cross shapes and hang them on the wall beside our gold-framed
      family photo. They would stay there until next Ash Wednesday, when we
      would take the fronds to church, to have them burned for ash. Papa, wearing a
      long, gray robe like the rest of the oblates, helped distribute ash every year.
      His line moved the slowest because he pressed hard on each forehead to make
      a perfect cross with his ash-covered thumb and slowly, meaningfully
      enunciated every word of “dust and unto dust you shall return.”</p>
      <p>Papa always sat in the front pew for Mass, at the end beside the middle
        aisle, with Mama, Jaja, and me sitting next to him. He was first to receive
        communion. Most people did not kneel to receive communion at the marble
        altar, with the blond lifesize Virgin Mary mounted nearby, but Papa did. He
        would hold his eyes shut so hard that his face tightened into a grimace, and
        then he would stick his tongue out as far as it could go. Afterward, he sat back
        on his seat and watched the rest of the congregation troop to the altar, palms
        pressed together and extended, like a saucer held sideways, just as Father
        Benedict had taught them to do. Even though Father Benedict had been at St.
        Agnes for seven years, people still referred to him as “our new priest.”
        Perhaps they would not have if he had not been white. He still looked new.
        The colors of his face, the colors of condensed milk and a cut-open soursop,
        had not tanned at all in the fierce heat of seven Nigerian harmattans. And his
        British nose was still as pinched and as narrow as it always was, the same
        nose that had had me worried that he did not get enough air when he first
        came to Enugu. Father Benedict had changed things in the parish, such as
        insisting that the Credo and kyrie be recited only in Latin; Igbo was not
        acceptable. Also, hand clapping was to be kept at a minimum, lest the
        solemnity of Mass be compromised. But he allowed offertory songs in Igbo;
        he called them native songs, and when he said “native” his straight-line lips
        turned down at the corners to form an inverted U. During his sermons, Father
        Benedict usually referred to the pope, Papa, and Jesus—in that order. He used
        Papa to illustrate the gospels. “When we let our light shine before men, we
        are reflecting Christ’s Triumphant Entry,” he said that Palm Sunday. “Look at
        Brother Eugene. He could have chosen to be like other Big Men in this
        country, he could have decided to sit at home and do nothing after the coup, to make sure the government did not threaten his businesses. But no, he used the
        Standard to speak the truth even though it meant the paper lost advertising.
        Brother Eugene spoke out for freedom. How many of us have stood up for the
        truth? How many of us have reflected the Triumphant Entry?</p>

        <p>The congregation said “Yes” or “God bless him” or “Amen,” but not too
          loudly so they would not sound like the mushroom Pentecostal churches; then
          they listened intently, quietly. Even the babies stopped crying, as if they, too,
          were listening. On some Sundays, the congregation listened closely even
          when Father Benedict talked about things everybody already knew, about
          Papa making the biggest donations to Peter’s pence and St. Vincent de Paul.
          Or about Papa paying for the cartons of communion wine, for the new ovens
          at the convent where the Reverend Sisters baked the host, for the new wing to
          St. Agnes Hospital where Father Benedict gave extreme unction. And I would
          sit with my knees pressed together, next to Jaja, trying hard to keep my face
          blank, to keep the pride from showing, because Papa said modesty was very
          important.   Papa himself would have a blank face when I looked at him, the kind of
          expression he had in the photo when they did the big story on him after
          Amnesty World gave him a human rights award. It was the only time he
          allowed himself to be featured in the paper. His editor, Ade Coker, had
          insisted on it, saying Papa deserved it, saying Papa was too modest. Mama
          told me and Jaja; Papa did not tell us such things. That blank look would
          remain on his face until Father Benedict ended the sermon, until it was time
          for communion. After Papa took communion, he sat back and watched the
          congregation walk to the altar and, after Mass, reported to Father Benedict,
          with concern, when a person missed communion on two successive Sundays.
          He always encouraged Father Benedict to call and win that person back into
          the fold; nothing but mortal sin would keep a person away from communion
          two Sundays in a row.
          </p>

          <p>So when Papa did not see Jaja go to the altar that Palm Sunday when
            everything changed, he banged his leatherbound missal, with the red and
            green ribbons peeking out, down on the dining table when we got home. The
            table was glass, heavy glass. It shook, as did the palm fronds on it.
            “Jaja, you did not go to communion,” Papa said quietly, almost a
            question.
            Jaja stared at the missal on the table as though he were addressing it.
            “The wafer gives me bad breath.   I stared at Jaja. Had something come loose in his head? Papa insisted we
            call it the host because “host” came close to capturing the essence, the
            sacredness, of Christ’s body. “Wafer” was too secular, wafer was what one of
            Papa’s factories made—chocolate wafer, banana wafer, what people bought
            their children to give them a treat better than biscuits. </p>

            <p>“And the priest keeps touching my mouth and it nauseates me,” Jaja
              said. He knew I was looking at him, that my shocked eyes begged him to seal
              his mouth, but he did not look at me.   “It is the body of our Lord.” Papa’s voice was low, very low. His face
              looked swollen already, with pus-tipped rashes spread across every inch, but it
              seemed to be swelling even more. “You cannot stop receiving the body of our
              Lord. It is death, you know that.   “Then I will die.” Fear had darkened Jaja’s eyes to the color of coal tar,
              but he looked Papa in the face now. “Then I will die, Papa.”
              Papa looked around the room quickly, as if searching for proof that
              something had fallen from the high ceiling, something he had never thought
              would fall. He picked up the missal and flung it across the room, toward Jaja.
              It missed Jaja completely, but it hit the glass étagerè, which Mama polished
              often. It cracked the top shelf, swept the beige, finger-size ceramic figurines
              of ballet dancers in various contorted postures to the hard floor and then
              landed after them. Or rather it landed on their many pieces. It lay there, a
              huge leather-bound missal that contained the readings for all three cycles of
              the church year.</p>

              <p> Jaja did not move. Papa swayed from side to side. I stood at the door,
                watching them. The ceiling fan spun round and round, and the light bulbs
                attached to it clinked against one another. Then Mama came in, her rubber
                slippers making slap-slap sounds on the marble floor. She had changed from
                her sequined Sunday wrapper and the blouse with puffy sleeves. Now she had
                a plain tie-dye wrapper tied loosely around her waist and that white T-shirt
                she wore every other day. It was a souvenir from a spiritual retreat she and
                Papa had attended; the words GOD IS LOVE crawled over her sagging breasts.
                She stared at the figurine pieces on the floor and then knelt and started to pick
                them up with her bare hands</p>

                <p>The silence was broken only by the whir of the ceiling fan as it sliced
                  through the still air. Although our spacious dining room gave way to an even
                  wider living room, I felt suffocated. The off-white walls with the framed
                  photos of Grandfather were narrowing, bearing down on me. Even the glass dining table was moving toward me.
                  “Nne, ngwa. Go and change,” Mama said to me, startling me although
                  her Igbo words were low and calming. In the same breath, without pausing,
                  she said to Papa, “Your tea is getting cold,” and to Jaja, “Come and help me,
                  biko.”</p>

                  <p>Papa sat down at the table and poured his tea from the china tea set with
                    pink flowers on the edges. I waited for him to ask Jaja and me to take a sip, as
                    he always did. A love sip, he called it, because you shared the little things you
                    loved with the people you loved. Have a love sip, he would say, and Jaja
                    would go first. Then I would hold the cup with both hands and raise it to my
                    lips. One sip. The tea was always too hot, always burned my tongue, and if
                    lunch was something peppery, my raw tongue suffered. But it didn’t matter,
                    because I knew that when the tea burned my tongue, it burned Papa’s love
                    into me. But Papa didn’t say, “Have a love sip”; he didn’t say anything as I
                    watched him raise the cup to his lips.</p>

                    <p>  Jaja knelt beside Mama, flattened the church bulletin he held into a
                      dustpan, and placed a jagged ceramic piece on it. “Careful, Mama, or those
                      pieces will cut your fingers,” he said.
                      I pulled at one of the cornrows underneath my black church scarf to
                      make sure I was not dreaming. Why were they acting so normal, Jaja and
                      Mama, as if they did not know what had just happened? And why was Papa
                      drinking his tea quietly, as if Jaja had not just talked back to him? Slowly, I
                      turned and headed upstairs to change out of my red Sunday dress.
                      I sat at my bedroom window after I changed; the cashew tree was so
                      close I could reach out and pluck a leaf if it were not for the silver-colored
                      crisscross of mosquito netting. The bell-shaped yellow fruits hung lazily,
                      drawing buzzing bees that bumped against my window’s netting. I heard Papa
                      walk upstairs to his room for his afternoon siesta. I closed my eyes, sat still,
                      waiting to hear him call Jaja, to hear Jaja go into his room. But after long,
                      silent minutes, I opened my eyes and pressed my forehead against the window
                      louvers to look outside. Our yard was wide enough to hold a hundred people
                      dancing atilogu, spacious enough for each dancer to do the usual somersaults
                      and land on the next dancer’s shoulders. The compound walls, topped by
                      coiled electric wires, were so high I could not see the cars driving by on our
                      street. It was early rainy season, and the frangipani trees planted next to the
                      walls already filled the yard with the sickly-sweet scent of their flowers. A
                      row of purple bougainvillea, cut smooth and straight as a buffet table,
                      separated the gnarled trees from the driveway. Closer to the house, vibrant  bushes of hibiscus reached out and touched one another as if they were
                      exchanging their petals. The purple plants had started to push out sleepy buds,
                      but most of the flowers were still on the red ones. They seemed to bloom so
                      fast, those red hibiscuses, considering how often Mama cut them to decorate
                      the church altar and how often visitors plucked them as they walked past to
                      their parked cars.
                      </p>

                      <p>It was mostly Mama’s prayer group members who plucked flowers; a
                        woman tucked one behind her ear once—I saw her clearly from my window.
                        But even the government agents, two men in black jackets who came some
                        time ago, yanked at the hibiscus as they left. They came in a pickup truck
                        with Federal Government plates and parked close to the hibiscus bushes.
                        They didn’t stay long. Later, Jaja said they came to bribe Papa, that he had
                        heard them say that their pickup was full of dollars. I was not sure Jaja had
                        heard correctly. But even now I thought about it sometimes. I imagined the
                        truck full of stacks and stacks of foreign money, wondered if they had put the
                        money in many cartons or in one huge carton, the size our fridge came in.</p>

                        <p>I was still at the window when Mama came into my room. Every Sunday
                          before lunch, in between telling Sisi to put a little more palm oil in the soup, a
                          little less curry in the coconut rice, and while Papa took his siesta, Mama
                          plaited my hair. She would sit on an armchair near the kitchen door and I on
                          the floor with my head cradled between her thighs. Although the kitchen was
                          airy, with the windows always open, my hair would still manage to absorb the
                          spices, and afterward, when I brought the end of a braid to my nose, I would
                          smell egusi soup, utazi, curry. But Mama did not come into my room with the
                          bag that held combs and hair oils and ask me to come downstairs. Instead, she
                          said, “Lunch is ready, nne.”</p>
                          <p>I meant to say I am sorry Papa broke your figurines, but the words that
                            came out were, “I’m sorry your figurines broke, Mama.”
                            She nodded quickly, then shook her head to show that the figurines did
                            not matter. They did, though. Years ago, before I understood, I used to wonder
                            why she polished them each time I heard the sounds from their room, like
                            something being banged against the door. Her rubber slippers never made a
                            sound on the stairs, but I knew she went downstairs when I heard the dining
                            room door open. I would go down to see her standing by the étagère with a
                            kitchen towel soaked in soapy water. She spent at least a quarter of an hour on
                            each ballet-dancing figurine. There were never tears on her face. The last
                            time, only two weeks ago, when her swollen eye was still the black-purple
                            color of an overripe avocado, she had rearranged them after she polished
                            them.
“I will plait your hair after lunch,” she said, turning to leave.
“Yes, Mama.</p>
