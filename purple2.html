<p>I followed her downstairs. She limped slightly, as though one leg were
  shorter than the other, a gait that made her seem even smaller than she was.
  The stairs curved elegantly in an S shape, and I was halfway down when I
  saw Jaja standing in the hallway. Usually he went to his room to read before
  lunch, but he had not come upstairs today; he had been in the kitchen the
  whole time, with Mama and Sisi.    “Ke kwanu?” I asked, although I did not need to ask how he was doing. I
  had only to look at him. His seventeen-year-old face had grown lines; they
  zigzagged across his forehead, and inside each line a dark tension had crawled
  in. I reached out and clasped his hand shortly before we went into the dining
  room. Papa and Mama were already seated, and Papa was washing his hands
  in the bowl of water Sisi held before him. He waited until Jaja and I sat down
  opposite him, and started the grace. For twenty minutes he asked God to bless
  the food. Afterward, he intoned the Blessed Virgin in several different titles
  while we responded, “Pray for us.” His favorite title was Our Lady, Shield of
  the Nigerian People. He had made it up himself. If only people would use it
  every day, he told us, Nigeria would not totter like a Big Man with the spindly
  legs of a child</p>

  <p>Lunch was fufu and onugbu soup. The fufu was smooth and fluffy. Sisi
    made it well; she pounded the yam energetically, adding drops of water into
    the mortar, her cheeks contracting with the thump-thump-thump of the pestle.
    The soup was thick with chunks of boiled beef and dried fish and dark green
    onugbu leaves. We ate silently. I molded my fufu into small balls with my
    fingers, dipped it in the soup, making sure to scoop up fish chunks, and then
    brought it to my mouth. I was certain the soup was good, but I did not taste it,
    could not taste it. My tongue felt like paper.</p>

    <p>Pass the salt, please,” Papa said.
      We all reached for the salt at the same time. Jaja and I touched the crystal
      shaker, my finger brushed his gently, then he let go. I passed it to Papa. The
      silence stretched out even longer.</p>

      <p>“They brought the cashew juice this afternoon. It tastes good. I am sure it
        will sell,” Mama finally said.
        “Ask that girl to bring it,” Papa said. Mama pressed the ringer that
        dangled above the table on a transparent wire from the ceiling, and Sisi
appeared.
“Yes, Madam?”
“Bring two bottles of the drink they brought from the factory.”
“Yes, Madam.”
</p>

<p>I wished Sisi had said “What bottles, Madam?” or “Where are they,
  Madam?” Just something to keep her and Mama talking, to veil the nervous
  movements of Jaja molding his fufu. Sisi was back shortly and placed the
  bottles next to Papa. They had the same faded-looking labels as every other
  thing Papa’s factories made—the wafers and cream biscuits and bottled juice
  and banana chips. Papa poured the yellow juice for everyone. I reached out
  quickly for my glass and took a sip. It tasted watery. I wanted to seem eager;
  maybe if I talked about how good it tasted, Papa might forget that he had not
  yet punished Jaja.</p>
  <p>“It’s very good, Papa,” I said.
    Papa swirled it around his bulging cheeks. “Yes, yes.”
    “It tastes like fresh cashew,” Mama said.
    Say something, please, I wanted to say to Jaja. He was supposed to say
    something now, to contribute, to compliment Papa’s new product. We always
    did, each time an employee from one of his factories brought a product
    sample for us.</p>

    <p>“Just like white wine,” Mama added. She was nervous, I could tell—not
      just because a fresh cashew tasted nothing like white wine but also because
      her voice was lower than usual. “White wine,” Mama said again, closing her
      eyes to better savor the taste. “Fruity white wine.”
      “Yes,” I said. A ball of fufu slipped from my fingers and into the soup</p>

      <p>Papa was staring pointedly at Jaja. “Jaja, have you not shared a drink
        with us, gbo? Have you no words in your mouth?” he asked, entirely in Igbo.
        A bad sign. He hardly spoke Igbo, and although Jaja and I spoke it with
        Mama at home, he did not like us to speak it in public. We had to sound
        civilized in public, he told us; we had to speak English. Papa’s sister, Aunty
        Ifeoma, said once that Papa was too much of a colonial product. She had said
        this about Papa in a mild, forgiving way, as if it were not Papa’s fault, as one
        would talk about a person who was shouting gibberish from a severe case of
        malaria</p> 
        <p>“Have you nothing to say, gbo, Jaja?” Papa asked again.
          “Mba, there are no words in my mouth,” Jaja replied.
          “What?” There was a shadow clouding Papa’s eyes, a shadow that had
          been in Jaja’s eyes. Fear. It had left Jaja’s eyes and entered Papa’s.
          “I have nothing to say,” Jaja said.
          “The juice is good—” Mama started to say.
          Jaja pushed his chair back. “Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Papa. Thank
          you, Mama.</p>
          <p>I turned to stare at him. At least he was saying thanks the right way, the
            way we always did after a meal. But he was also doing what we never did: he
            was leaving the table before Papa had said the prayer after meals.
            “Jaja!” Papa said. The shadow grew, enveloping the whites of Papa’s
            eyes. Jaja was walking out of the dining room with his plate. Papa made to get
            up and then slumped back on his seat. His cheeks drooped, bulldoglike.</p>
            <p>I reached for my glass and stared at the juice, watery yellow, like urine. I
              poured all of it down my throat, in one gulp. I didn’t know what else to do.
              This had never happened before in my entire life, never. The compound walls
              would crumble, I was sure, and squash the frangipani trees. The sky would
              cave in. The Persian rugs on the stretches of gleaming marble floor would
              shrink. Something would happen. But the only thing that happened was my
              choking. My body shook from the coughing. Papa and Mama rushed over.
              Papa thumped my back while Mama rubbed my shoulders and said, “O zugo.
              Stop coughing.”</p>

              <p>THAT EVENING, I STAYED in bed and did not have dinner with the family. I
                developed a cough, and my cheeks burned the back of my hand. Inside my
                head, thousands of monsters played a painful game of catch, but instead of a
                ball, it was a brown leather-bound missal that they threw to each other. Papa
                came into my room; my mattress sank in when he sat and smoothed my
                cheeks and asked if I wanted anything else. Mama was already making me
                ofe nsala. I said no, and we sat silently, our hands clasped for a long time.
                Papa’s breathing was always noisy, but now he panted as if he were out of
                breath, and I wondered what he was thinking, if perhaps he was running in his
                mind, running away from something. I did not look at his face because I did
                not want to see the rashes that spread across every inch of it, so many, so
                evenly spread that they made his skin look bloated</p>
                <p>Mama brought some ofe nsala up for me a little later, but the aromatic
                  soup only made me nauseated. After I vomited in the bathroom, I asked
                  Mama where Jaja was. He had not come in to see me since after lunch.
                  “In his room. He did not come down for dinner.” She was caressing my
                  cornrows; she liked to do that, to trace the way strands of hair from different
                  parts of my scalp meshed and held together. She would keep off plaiting it
                  until next week. My hair was too thick; it always tightened back into a dense
                  bunch right after she ran a comb through it. Trying to comb it now would
                  enrage the monsters already in my head.
                  “Will you replace the figurines?” I asked. I could smell the chalky
                  deodorant under her arms. Her brown face, flawless but for the recent jagged
                  scar on her forehead, was expressionless.</p>
                  <p>“Kpa,” she said. “I will not replace them.”
                    Maybe Mama had realized that she would not need the figurines
                    anymore; that when Papa threw the missal at Jaja, it was not just the figurines
                    that came tumbling down, it was everything. I was only now realizing it, only
                    just letting myself think it.
                    I lay in bed after Mama left and let my mind rake through the past,
                    through the years when Jaja and Mama and I spoke more with our spirits than
                    with our lips. Until Nsukka. Nsukka started it all; Aunty Ifeoma’s little garden
                    next to the verandah of her flat in Nsukka began to lift the silence. Jaja’s
                    defiance seemed to me now like Aunty Ifeoma’s experimental purple
                    hibiscus: rare, fragrant with the undertones of freedom, a different kind of
                    freedom from the one the crowds waving green leaves chanted at Government
                    Square after the coup. A freedom to be, to do.
                    But my memories did not start at Nsukka. They started before, when all
                    the hibiscuses in our front yard were a startling red</p>
