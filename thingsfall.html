            <P>Okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even 
                beyond. His fame rested on solid personal achievements. As a 
                young man of eighteen he had brought honor to his village by 
                throwing Amalinze the Cat. Amalinze was the great wrestler who 
                for seven years was unbeaten, from Umuofia to Mbaino. He was 
                called the Cat because his back would never touch the earth. It was 
                this man that Okonkwo threw in a fight which the old men agreed 
                was one of the fiercest since the founder of their town engaged a 
                spirit of the wild for seven days and seven nights.  </p>
                <p>The drums beat and the flutes sang and the spectators held their 
                breath. Amalinze was a wily craftsman, but Okonkwo was as 
                slippery as a fish in water. Every nerve and every muscle stood out 
                on their arms, on their backs and their thighs, and one almost heard 
                them stretching to breaking point. In the end Okonkwo threw the 
                Cat.</p>
                <p>   That was many years ago, twenty years or more, and during this 
                    time Okonkwo's fame had grown like a bush-fire in the harmattan. 
                    He was tall and huge, and his bushy eyebrows and wide nose gave 
                    him a very severe look. He breathed heavily, and it was said that, 
                    when he slept, his wives and children in their houses could hear 
                    him breathe. When he walked, his heels hardly touched the ground 
                    and he seemed to walk on springs, as if he was going to pounce on 
                    somebody. And he did pounce on people quite often. He had a 
                    slight stammer and whenever he was angry and could not get his 
                    words out quickly enough, he would use his fists. He had no 
                    patience with unsuccessful men. He had had no patience with his 
                    father. </p>

                    <p> Unoka, for that was his father's name, had died ten years ago. In 
                        his day he was lazy and improvident and was quite incapable of 
                        thinking about tomorrow. If any money came his way, and it 
                        seldom did, he immediately bought gourds of palm-wine, called 
                        round his neighbors and made merry. He always said that 
                        whenever he saw a dead man's mouth he saw the folly of not eating 
                        what one had in one's lifetime. Unoka was, of course, a debtor, and 
                        he owed every neighbor some money, from a few cowries to quite 
                        substantial amounts.</p>

                        <p>He was tall but very thin and had a slight stoop. He wore a haggard 
                            and mournful look except when he was drinking or playing on his 
                            flute. He was very good on his flute, and his happiest moments 
                            were the two or three moons after the harvest when the village 
                            musicians brought down their instruments, hung above the 
                            fireplace. Unoka would play with them, his face beaming with 
                            blessedness and peace. Sometimes another village would ask 
                            Unoka's band and their dancing egwugwu to come and stay with 
                            them and teach them their tunes. They would go to such hosts for 
                            as long as three or four markets, making music and feasting. 
                            Unoka loved the good hire and the good fellowship, and he loved 
                            this season of the year, when the rains had stopped and the sun rose  every morning with dazzling beauty. And it was not too hot either, 
                            because the cold and dry harmattan wind was blowing down Irom 
                            the north. Some years the harmattan was very severe and a dense 
                            haze hung on the atmosphere. Old men and children would then sit 
                            round log fires, warming their bodies. Unoka loved it all, and he 
                            loved the first kites that returned with the dry season, and the 
                            children who sang songs of welcome to them. He would remember 
                            his own childhood, how he had often wandered around looking for 
                            a kite sailing leisurely against the blue sky. As soon as he found 
                            one he would sing with his whole being, welcoming it back from 
                            its long, long journey, and asking it if it had brought home any 
                            lengths of cloth.</p>

                            <P>  That was years ago, when he was young. Unoka, the grown-up, 
                                was a failure. He was poor and his wife and children had barely 
                                enough to eat. People laughed at him because he was a loafer, and 
                                they swore never to lend him any more money because he never 
                                paid back. But Unoka was such a man that he always succeeded in 
                                borrowing more, and piling up his debts.</P>

                            <p>One day a neighbor called Okoye came in to see him. He was 
                                reclining on a mud bed in his hut playing on the flute. He 
                                immediately rose and shook hands with Okoye, who then unrolled 
                                the goatskin which he carried under his arm, and sat down. Unoka 
                                went into an inner room and soon returned with a small wooden 
                                disc containing a kola nut, some alligator pepper and a lump of 
                                white chalk.</p>

                                <p>"I have kola," he announced when he sat down, and passed the disc 
                                    over to his guest. 
                                    "Thank you. He who brings kola brings life. But I think you ought 
                                    to break it," replied Okoye, passing back the disc. 
                                    "No, it is for you, I think," and they argued like this for a few 
                                    moments before Unoka accepted the honor of breaking the kola. 
                                    Okoye, meanwhile, took the lump of chalk, drew some lines on the 
floor, and then painted his big toe.</p>
                                    <P>As he broke the kola, Unoka prayed to their ancestors for life and 
                                        health, and for protection against their enemies. When they had 
                                        eaten they talked about many things: about the heavy rains which 
                                        were drowning the yams, about the next ancestral feast and about 
                                        the impending war with the village of Mbaino. Unoka was never 
                                        happy when it came to wars. He was in fact a coward and could 
                                        not bear the sight of blood. And so he changed the subject and 
                                        talked about music, and his face beamed. He could hear in his 
                                        mind's ear the blood-stirring and intricate rhythms of the ekwe and 
                                        the udu and the ogene, and he could hear his own flute weaving in 
                                        and out of them, decorating them with a colorful and plaintive tune. 
                                        The total effect was gay and brisk, but if one picked out the flute as 
                                        it went up and down and then broke up into short snatches, one 
                                        saw that there was sorrow and grief there.</P>

                                        <p>Okoye was also a musician. He played on the ogene. But he was 
                                            not a failure like Unoka. He had a large barn full of yams and he 
                                            had three wives. And now he was going to take the Idemili title, 
                                            the third highest in the land. It was a very expensive ceremony and 
                                            he was gathering all his resources together. That was in fact the 
                                            reason why he had come to see Unoka. He cleared his throat and 
                                            began  "Thank you for the kola. You may have heard of the title I intend 
                                            to take shortly." 
                                            Having spoken plainly so far, Okoye said the next half a dozen 
                                            sentences in proverbs. Among the Ibo the art of conversation is 
                                            regarded very highly, and proverbs are the palm-oil with which 
                                            words are eaten. Okoye was a great talker and he spoke for a long 
                                            time, skirting round the subject and then hitting it finally. In short, 
                                            he was asking Unoka to return the two hundred cowries he had 
                                            borrowed from him more than two years before. As soon as Unoka 
understood what his friend was driving at, he burst out laughing. 
He laughed loud and long and his voice rang out clear as the ogene, 
and tears stood in his eyes. His visitor was amazed, and sat 
speechless. At the end, Unoka was able to give an answer between 
fresh outbursts of mirth.</p>

                                            <p>"Look at that wall," he said, pointing at the far wall of his hut, 
                                                which was rubbed with red earth so that it shone. "Look at those 
                                                lines of chalk," and Okoye saw groups of short perpendicular lines 
                                                drawn in chalk. There were five groups, and the smallest group had 
                                                ten lines. Unoka had a sense of the dramatic and so he allowed a 
                                                pause, in which he took a pinch of snuff and sneezed noisily, and 
                                                then he continued: "Each group there represents a debt to someone, 
                                                and each stroke is one hundred cowries. You see, I owe that man a 
                                                thousand cowries. But he has not come to wake me up in the 
                                                morning for it. I shall pay you, but not today. Our elders say that 
                                                the sun will shine on those who stand before it shines on those who 
                                                kneel under them. I shall pay my big debts first." And he took 
                                                another pinch of snuff, as if that was paying the big debts first. 
                                                Okoye rolled his goatskin and departed.</p>
                                                <p>When Unoka died he had taken no title at all and he was heavily 
                                                    in debt. Any wonder then that his son Okonkwo was ashamed of 
                                                    him? Fortunately, among these people a man was judged according 
                                                    to his worth and not according to the worth of his father. Okonkwo 
                                                    was clearly cut out for great things. He was still young but he had 
                                                    won fame as the greatest wrestler in the nine villages. He was a 
                                                    wealthy farmer and had two barns full of yams, and had just 
                                                    married his third wife. To crown it all he had taken two titles and 
                                                    had shown incredible prowess in two inter-tribal wars. And so 
                                                    although Okonkwo was still young, he was already one of the 
                                                    greatest men of his time. Age was respected among his people, but 
                                                    achievement was revered. As the elders said, if a child washed his 
                                                    hands he could eat with kings. Okonkwo had clearly washed his hands and so he ate with kings and elders. And that was how he 
                                                    came to look after the doomed lad who was sacrificed to the 
                                                    village of Umuofia by their neighbors to avoid war and bloodshed. 
                                                    The ill-fated lad was called Ikemefuna.</p>

        <p>Okonkwo had just blown out the palm-oil lamp and stretched 
            himself on his bamboo bed when he heard the ogene of the town 
            crier piercing the still night air. Gome, gome, gome, gome, boomed 
            the hollow metal. Then the crier gave his message, and at the end 
            of it beat his instrument again. And this was the message. Every 
            man of Umuofia was asked to gather at the market place tomorrow 
            morning. Okonkwo wondered what was amiss, for he knew 
            certainly that something was amiss. He had discerned a clear 
            overtone of tragedy in the crier's voice, and even now he could still 
            hear it as it grew dimmer and dimmer in the distance. </p>
